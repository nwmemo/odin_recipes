    <p><em>"Lasagne is a classic Italian al forno dish that generally consists of alternating layers of pasta sheets and various fillings, <br> including - though not exclusively - ragù, besciamella and cheese, such as mozzarella, ricotta or Parmesan."</em></p>
    <br>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 olive oil, plus extra for the dish</li>
        <li>750g lean beef mince</li>
        <li>90g pack prosciutto</li>
        <li>800g passata or half our basic tomato sauce</li>
        <li>200ml hot beef stock</li>
        <li>nutmeg</li>
        <li>300g fresh lasagne sheets</li>
        <li>white sauce (find a recipe in the method, or use shop-bought)</li>
        <li>125g ball mozzarella, torn into thin strips</li>
    </ul>
<br>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li></li>
            <p>To make the meat sauce, heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a frying pan and cook 750g lean beef mince in two batches for about 10 mins until browned all over.</p>
        <li></li>
            <p>Finely chop 4 slices of prosciutto from a 90g pack, then stir through the meat mixture.</p>
        <li> </li>
            <p>Pour over 800g passata or half our basic tomato sauce recipe and 200ml hot beef stock. Add a little grated nutmeg, then season.</p>
        <li></li>
            <p>Bring up to the boil, then simmer for 30 mins until the sauce looks rich.</p>
        <li></li>
            <p>Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and lightly oil an ovenproof dish (about 30 x 20cm).</p>
        <li></li>
            <p>Spoon one third of the meat sauce into the dish, then cover with some fresh lasagne sheets from a 300g pack. Drizzle over roughly 130g ready-made or homemade white sauce.
            </p>
        <li></li>
            <p>Repeat until you have three layers of pasta. Cover with the remaining 390g white sauce, making sure you can’t see any pasta poking through.</p>
        <li></li>
            <p>Scatter 125g torn mozzarella over the top.</p>
        <li></li>
            <p>Arrange the rest of the prosciutto on top. Bake for 45 mins until the top is bubbling and lightly browned.</p>
